I hope this will explain the purpose of our zap to the AMASPZAP
program.

We have application software that doubles as a DFHSM replacement
in regard to migration/backup.

This software as part of its daily processing makes hundreds of
VTOC updates and Netview Automation was being used to answer the

AMA117D REPLY Y OR N TO UPDATE VTOC
Message.

Netview could not cope with the volume of WTORs that were being
generated at times hence this solution.

The rename has been done as:

1.  A precaution against misuse.

2.  To allow testing.

3.  To avoid confusion with the original.



Take care and best wishes
