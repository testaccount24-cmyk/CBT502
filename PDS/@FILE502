//***FILE 502 contains code from Charles MacNiven, to zap a copy    *   FILE 502
//*           of the AMASPZAP program, so as to eliminate its       *   FILE 502
//*                                                                 *   FILE 502

//*           message.  The member $$NOTE explains why it was       *   FILE 502
//*           necessary to make this modification.  I am including  *   FILE 502
//*           this mod here, in the hope that it might be useful    *   FILE 502
//*           to somebody.  It also illustrates something about     *   FILE 502
//*           how to zap a system module when you need to change    *   FILE 502
//*           it.  MVS 3.8 source code was used to help get our     *   FILE 502
//*           bearings, while attempting to read the appropriate    *   FILE 502
//*           parts of the load module of the newer code.           *   FILE 502
